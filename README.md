# youtube_to_mp3
Uses youtube-dl to get MP3 file and give metadata

After getting tired of trying to solve the error "ERROR: audio conversion failed: Unknown encoder 'libmp3lame'", I made this script to download the video from YouTube using youtube-dl and ffmpeg to convert to MP3 and add tags, renaming the file.

How to use: bash youtube_to_mp3.sh <URL> "Artist - Title"
